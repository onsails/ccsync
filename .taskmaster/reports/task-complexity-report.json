			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Project Setup and CLI Command Structure",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down project initialization, CLI structure definition, command/flag parsing, and help/error output validation into discrete subtasks.",
			"reasoning": "This task is foundational but follows well-established patterns in Rust CLI development using the `clap` crate. While there are multiple commands and flags, the implementation is straightforward with modern tooling. The main complexity comes from ensuring modular code structure and comprehensive help/error handling, but there are no deep algorithmic or architectural challenges. Testing is well-supported by existing libraries."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "File Scanning, Filtering, and Symlink Resolution",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose into directory traversal, type filtering, symlink resolution, broken/loop detection, and cross-platform path handling.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves recursive file system operations, symlink handling (including loop and broken link detection), and platform-specific path logic. While the `walkdir` crate simplifies traversal, robust symlink and error handling, as well as cross-platform compatibility, add moderate complexity. Testing requires realistic directory structures and edge cases."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "File Comparison, Diff Generation, and Conflict Detection",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split into file hashing, timestamp tracking, diff generation, conflict detection, resolution strategy implementation, and atomic file operations.",
			"reasoning": "Efficiently comparing files, generating diffs, and handling conflicts (with multiple resolution strategies) requires careful design. Integrating hashing, timestamp checks, and safe file operations (atomicity, staging) increases complexity. The need to support both interactive and automated modes, and to handle large/binary files, further raises the bar."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Interactive and Non-Interactive Operation Modes",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Separate into interactive prompt logic, non-interactive automation, dry-run simulation, session state management, and signal/exit handling.",
			"reasoning": "Supporting both interactive and automated workflows, with robust prompt logic, dry-run simulation, and graceful interruption handling, requires careful state management and user experience considerations. The `dialoguer` and `ctrlc` crates help, but integrating these modes with the rest of the system and ensuring correct exit codes adds moderate complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Configuration File Parsing, Merging, and Pattern Matching",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into config file discovery, parsing, precedence merging, pattern matching, direction/type-specific rules, and error reporting.",
			"reasoning": "Loading and merging configuration from multiple sources with correct precedence, supporting additive and override semantics, and implementing gitignore-style pattern matching is non-trivial. The need for robust error reporting and validation, as well as direction/type-specific logic, increases the implementation and testing effort."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Bidirectional Synchronization Logic (to-local and to-global)",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into sync planning, action determination, filter application, conflict handling, symlink management, atomic writes, and summary reporting.",
			"reasoning": "This is the core logic that integrates all previous components. It requires orchestrating scanning, filtering, diffing, config application, and conflict resolution in a robust, atomic, and user-safe manner. Ensuring no data loss, correct statistics, and safe failure modes makes this task the most complex, demanding careful design and comprehensive testing."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Inspection and Debugging Commands (status, diff, config)",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Separate into status summary, diff display, config inspection, and output formatting/testing.",
			"reasoning": "These commands are read-only and leverage existing logic for comparison and config handling. The main complexity lies in presenting accurate, actionable, and well-formatted output, as well as supporting config debugging features. Implementation is straightforward but requires attention to usability and correctness."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Cross-Platform Support, Error Handling, and Documentation",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into platform compatibility testing, error handling strategy, atomic file operations, documentation writing, CLI help/man page generation, and user feedback validation.",
			"reasoning": "Ensuring robust operation across Linux, macOS, and Windows, with comprehensive error handling and thorough documentation, is a significant undertaking. Platform-specific quirks, permission issues, and user guidance/documentation all require careful attention. While not algorithmically complex, the breadth and thoroughness required make this a high-effort task."
